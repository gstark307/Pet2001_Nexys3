October, 2011.

A Commodore PET in a Spartan-6 FPGA.

This is a Xilinx ISE Project targeted for a Digilent Nexys3 Development
board.  Opening up Pet2001.xise should do the trick.

A pre-built bit file with rev 2 ROMs is included here (pet2001.bit).  I
download the design to the board over the "Adept USB port" using the
djtgcfg utility (I'm running Linux):

   djtgcfg prog -d Nexys3 -i 0 -f pet2001.bit

See rtl/Pet2001_Nexys3.v for I/O assignments.  Until I can solve problems
with the Nexys3 "USB HID" interface, the keyboard needs to be wired into
PMOD connector PA.  Note that PS/2 keyboards need 5v+ power (vcc on the PMOD
connectors is 3.3v).  I got it off jumper JP1 located close by.

The key mappings are a bit odd and could be improved.  Mostly, you type
as you would on a PS/2 keyboard, not a PET keyboard.  The ALT key becomes
the PET's shift key so you can access graphics.  F1 is the STOP key.  The
Menu key is the RVS key.  Only down and right are mapped so alt-down is
up and alt-right is left.  Yeah, this needs work.

The cassette interface is not well documented because I want to replace it
with something that doesn't require soldering a wire on the Nexys3 board
(I've wired the FT232's CTS# signal to a PMOD connector for flow-control).
